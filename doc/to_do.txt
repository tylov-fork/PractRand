post-0.86:
	high priority items
		adaptor to produce a polymorphic RNG from a raw RNG automatically
			(to simplify users sticking their own RNG in to the test program at full performance)
		revise basic testing interface
		review serialization & seeding interface
	add benchmarks for seeding
		and optimize any slow-but-easily-improved seeding functions
		maybe add alternate fast-seeding interfaces too
	add more self-tests, regression tests, etc
		test vectors for ISAAC64, SHA2-512, & jsf32
		checks that fast-forward / rewind works correctly
		checks that entropy pooling works correctly
	review / reorganize header files
		some headers protect against multiple inclusion, some don't
		some headers protect against inclusion prior to dependencies, some don't
		test_helpers should probably be split in two
	RNG testing
		revise basic interface
			allow RNG tests to report multiple results
			ie have internal subtests, like a multiplex transform but not addressable
		consider splitting in to a separate library
			yes, it's already a semi-separate .lib file, but...
			maybe it should also have separate:
				names, SourceForge project pages, VC project files, downloads
		revise specific RNG testing algorithms
			Gap16
				possible minor bug in get_result, fix and recalibrate
				possibly count sequential identical gaps
			DC6
				investigate Bob Jenkins suggestion of applying to x^(x>>1)
			BCFN
				many variations to investigate; currently focused on BCACN
			CoupGap
				try to get more testable factors per run
			FPF
				optimize strides 2,4,8,16
			Rares
				publish
			BCN_generic
				worth more investigation
			...others
				most of the others don't appear to be worth the effort
		create new tests
			as BCFN, but calc the avg # of 1s in blocks after each sequence of #s of 1s
			something gapish on more than 16 bits at a time
			consider more autowindowing / leveling
			investigate idea: design a test for running on GPUs
		possible modifications to test interfaces
			allow a single test to be multithread?
		increase automation & quality of calibration process
	test program(s)
		improve clarity & quality of example code (TestManager)
			possibly move TestManager class in to library or a shared header
	choices in library to be reconsidered:
		names of randlf, randli
			perhaps: rand_sint32, rand_sint64, rand_uint32, rand_uint64, rand_float, rand_double, fast_uint32
		ranges to randf, randi, randlf, randli: [min..max) or [min..max]
		should unseeded RNGs require explicit SEED_NONE flag?
		change return type of RNG::get_name to something that doesn't require STL (ie write to buffer)?
		should split add_entropy* methods off from vRNG in to a new child class?
*		serialization interface needs more work & thought I think
			same for seeding of non-polymorphic RNGs
		???
	review and add to documentation
		detailed descriptions of RNGs, particularly recommended RNGs
		RNG basics
		RNG selection
		RNG qualities
		RNG distributions
		RNG seed management and entropy collection
		RNGs and multithreading
		RNGs and exotic platforms
		RNGs and cryptography
		RNG testing / RNG tests
		RNG theory and analysis
