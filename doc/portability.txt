1. Portability of programs using PractRand:
	In general, PractRands attempts to produce identical results across 
	all platforms.  However, there are some exceptions, particularly 
	with regard to endianness.  These exceptions include:
		Some non-recommended RNGs may produce different results on big 
			endian platforms than on little endian platforms
		There are numerous minor endianness issues in the tests, and in 
			how the TestBlocks for the tests are filled.  These tend to 
			cause tests results to not be identical between big and 
			little endian platforms, though the differences are minor.  

2. Portability of PractRand itself:
	I have built PractRand on:
		gcc 4.6.1 / x86-64 (64-bit) / Ubuntu Linux
		gcc 4.5.4 / MinGW x64 (64-bit)
		gcc 3.4.5 / MinGW x86 (32-bit) - though TLS was not supported
		VC 2010 x86 (32-bit)

	When compiling on a other platform, the first thing that must be done 
		is a few minor edits in include/PractRand/config.h

	In addition to that, the basic version of PractRand requires:
		note:
			if you don't know what any of these means, don't freak;
			this stuff all basically just translates to a reasonably 
			compliant C++ compiler and a normal hardware environment 
			typical of modern PCs and most embedded chips.  
		support for 8, 16, 32, and 64 bit signed and unsigned integers
		memory be addressed in 8-bit units (sizeof(Uint8) == 1)
		basic C++ support including namespaces and templates
			 all decent C++ compilers qualify
		the standard C/C++ library, including STL
			 all decent C++ compilers support this
		endianness must be either big endian or little endian
			all remotely modern architectures qualify
		auto-seeding & automatic entropy work best on either Windows or *nix
			see automatic_entropy.cpp
			You can add code there for your platform
			If you just use the generic code on an unrecognized platform there 
				will be an increased chance that autoseeding will produce 
				duplicate seeds
		IEEE floating point
			only required for randf & randlf methods
				and even then nothing very bad happens if it's not compliant
				and it can be adjusted for non-IEEE formats in RNG_internals.h


	In addition to that, the example programs may require:
		C++ RTTI (part of the C++ language)
