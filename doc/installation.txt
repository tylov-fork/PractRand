1.  Configuring PractRand:
The file include/PractRand/config.h contains PractRands configuration.  
Depending upon your platform and compiler, you may need to edit it.  It 
includes comments that tell you what to do.  

2.  Building PractRand:
PractRand currently comes with precomiled static libraries (.lib files) 
built with MSVC for WIN32 / x86.  
If you can't use the precompiled .lib files it comes with then you'll 
need to rebuild PractRand.  
It comes with an MSVC project file.  
It does *NOT* come with build files for make / autoconf / etc.  
If you can't use the MSVC project file then you'll need to manually 
compile and link all .cpp files in the PractRand src/ directory and 
all of its subdirectories, recursively.  At the moment that means:
src/*.cpp
src/RNGs/*.cpp
src/RNGs/other/*.cpp
PractRand is intended to be built as a static library.  

3.  Linking with PractRand:
Same as for any other static library on your compiler.
