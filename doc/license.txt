I release all of my work on PractRand to the public domain.  

All statistical tests in PractRand are wholly my own work, and 
are public domain.  

All the auxillary code is by myself and thus public domain.  

All of the recommended RNGs are unencumbered:
	jsf* was designed by Robert Jenkins, and he has released it to 
	the public domain.  The implementation is mostly his code with a 
	little of my own.  

	isaac* was designed by Robert Jenkins, and he has released it to 
	the public domain.  The implementation is mostly his code with a 
	little of my own.  

	mwlac* was designed and coded by myself, and is public domain.  

	efiix* was designed and coded by myself, and is public domain.  

	hc256: "The stream ciphers HC-128 and HC-256 are not patented and 
	are royalty free. Anyone can use HC-128 and HC-256 free of charge."

	lcg64_32 is an unencumbered algorithm.  The implementation was 
	coded by myself, and is public domain.  

	clcg96_32 is an unencumbered algorithm.  The implementation was 
	coded by myself, and is public domain.  

	mt19937 is an unencumbered algorithm (though it wasn't always IIRC).  
	The implementation was coded by myself, and is public domain.  

	ibaa* was designed by Robert Jenkins, and he has released it to 
	the public domain.  The implementation is mostly his code with a 
	little of my own.   

The extra RNGs included in the research package... are more numerous, and 
less important, since they mostly are not intended to actually ship with 
any real product.  The code for them was either written by myself or 
copied from a public location.
