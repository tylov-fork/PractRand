Specific Tests in PractRand:
Recommended tests:
	Gap16 - a variation of the classic "Gap" test; no parameters 
		required
	BCFN - checks for long range linear correlations (bit counting);
		in practice this often detects Fibonacci style RNGs that 
		rely upon large lags to defeat other statistical tests; 
		only a single integer parameter is needed, it is the 
		log-base-2 of the size of the table is uses internally - 
		recommended values are 10 to 15, or larger values if cache 
		is VERY large and/or main memory is VERY low latency.  
	DC6 - checks for short range linear correlations (bit counting); 
		takes several parameters that determine the size of 
		integers it operates on internally, the number of adjacent 
		such integers it looks for correlations between, and which 
		information it uses for each such integer; for recommended 
		values see the code for get_core_tests() and 
		get_expanded_core_tests() in test_batteries.cpp.  
Transforms:
	(these appear as tests but are simply wrappers for other tests)
	multiplex - simply routes operations on this test to multiple 
		subtests
	lowbits - for each 1,2,4,or 8 bytes this takes the lowest 1,2,4,8,16, 
		or 32 bits and routes them to the wrapped tests)
	shrink - 
	FirstNofM - 
Non-recommended tests:
	FPF - "floating point frequency" test; contrary to the name 
		it's purely integer math.  Can be very slow on some settings.  
		Tends to not be very good.  
	CoupGap - "Coupon / Gap hybrid" test; still in development;
		behavior is similar to most gap tests
	...many more still to come
