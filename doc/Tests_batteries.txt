========================================================================
PractRand defines several batteries of tests for RNGs.  These are 
defined as PractRand::Tests::ListOfTests and as functions in 
PractRand::Tests::Batteries that return ListOfTests objects.  When you 
are done with a ListOfTests returned by one of those functions you 
should call PractRand::Tests::Batteries::destruct_tests on it to 
deallocate the resources used by the tests.  

The recommended batteries defined in PractRand are:
standard - get_standard_tests() - This is the recommended battery of 
	tests for PractRand.  It is intended to quickly find bias in a wide 
	variety of RNGs.  Some important notes:
	1. This battery actually internally consists of several very 
	closely related batteries, of which one is chosen based upon the 
	output format of the RNG to be tested (determined by checking the 
	metadata).  Each variant puts a little extra effort in to checking 
	the low bits of the RNGs output (because the nature of operations 
	offered on modern computers tends to lead to flaws in the low bits 
	of fast PRNGs).  It must know the output format of the RNG to 
	figure out which bits are the low bits.  For this reason 
	get_standard_tests() takes a pointer at a polymorphic RNG as a 
	parameter - it checks the metadata on the RNG, but doesn't do 
	anything else, and has no side effects upon the RNG.  
	2. This battery is optimized for efficiency over sensitivity to a 
	much greater degree than other batteries - it is poor at detecting 
	bias on a per-bit basis but makes up for it by being very good at 
	detecting bias on a per-second basis.  
core - get_core_tests() - Not generally recommended.  This is the same 
	as the "standard" battery except that it does not put extra effort 
	in to targeting certain bits.  

Additional batteries are provided by PractRand for the sake of 
completeness, but are not recommended.  Those are:
extra foldings - get_folded_tests() - Not generally recommended.  This 
	is the same as the "standard" battery except that it puts extra 
	effort in to targeting a wide variety of different bits of the 
	output.  
expanded core - get_expanded_core_tests() - Not generally recommended.  
	This includes the "core" battery plus a bunch of additional tests 
	that were considered inferior to the core tests.  
expanded standard - get_expanded_standard_tests() - Not generally 
	recommended.  This includes the "expanded core" tests, plus it pays 
	extra attention to certain bits of the output, like the "standard" 
	battery.  
expanded with extra foldings - get_expanded_folded_tests() - Not 
	generally recommended.  This includes the "expanded standard" 
	battery, but it puts extra effort in to targeting a wide variety of 
	different bits of the output, like the "extra foldings" battery.
